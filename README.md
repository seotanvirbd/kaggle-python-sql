# End-to-End Data Analysis: From Kaggle API to Pandas Data Cleaning to PostgreSQL Data Analysis to Power BI Dashboards

## üìä Project Overview
![Project Flow](https://github.com/seotanvirbd/kaggle-python-sql/blob/main/DATA_ANALYSIS.png)
A comprehensive data analysis project that demonstrates the complete data pipeline from data collection to visualization. The project analyzes sales, profit, and revenue data using various tools and technologies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas) for data cleaning
- Kaggle API for data collection
- PostgreSQL for data storage and analysis
- Power BI for visualization
- SQL for data querying

## üìã Project Structure
1. **Data Collection**
   - Utilized Kaggle API to fetch CSV datasets
   - Automated data retrieval process

2. **Data Cleaning (Python/Pandas)**
   - Handled missing values
   - Standardized data formats
   - Created derived columns
   - Removed duplicates

3. **Database Operations**
   - PostgreSQL database setup
   - Data import and storage
   - Complex SQL queries for analysis
     Creating Table
     ```
     create table afra_pd(
				order_id int primary key,

				ship_mode varchar(20),
				segment varchar(20),
				country varchar(20),
				city varchar(20),
				state varchar(20),
				postal_code varchar(20),

				profit decimal(7,2));
      ```


4. **Data Analysis**
Key insights revealed through SQL analysis:
- Top 10 revenue-generating products

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Query 1: Find Top 10 Highest Revenue Generating Products üõçÔ∏èüí∞

```sql
--Q-1: find top 10 highest revenue generating products 

SELECT
      product_id, 
      SUM(sale_price)
FROM 
      afra_pd
GROUP BY 
      product_id
ORDER BY 
      SUM(sale_price) DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
### Explanation

- **`SELECT product_id, SUM(sale_price)`** ‚û°Ô∏è We want to find the total revenue (`SUM(sale_price)`) generated for each product (`product_id`).

- **`FROM afra_pd`** ‚û°Ô∏è The data is coming from the `afra_pd` table.

- **`GROUP BY product_id`** ‚û°Ô∏è Group the results by `product_id` so we can calculate the sum for each product.

- **`ORDER BY SUM(sale_price) DESC`** ‚û°Ô∏è Sort the products by total revenue, from highest to lowest.

- **`LIMIT 10`** ‚û°Ô∏è Only show the top 10 highest revenue-generating products.


## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Query 2: Find Top 5 Highest Selling Products in Each Region üèòÔ∏èüìà
```
WITH cte AS (
        SELECT 
            region,
            product_id,
            SUM(sale_price) AS sales
        FROM 
            afra_pd
        GROUP BY 
            region, product_id
)
SELECT * 
FROM (
        SELECT *,
               ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY region ORDER BY sales DESC) AS rn
        FROM cte
) A
WHERE rn <= 5;
```

### Explanation

- **`WITH cte AS (...)`** ‚û°Ô∏è We create a Common Table Expression (CTE) `cte` to calculate the total sales for each product in every region.

- **`ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY region ORDER BY sales DESC)`** ‚û°Ô∏è For each region, assign a rank (`ROW_NUMBER()`) based on the total sales of each product, with the highest sales ranked first.

- **`SELECT * FROM (...) WHERE rn <= 5`** ‚û°Ô∏è Filter the results to only include the top 5 products for each region 5Ô∏è‚É£.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Query 3: Month-over-Month Growth Comparison for Sales in 2022 vs. 2023
### Purpose
To compare sales growth month-over-month between 2022 and 2023.
SQL Code (Microsoft SQL Server)

```
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        YEAR(order_date) AS order_year,
        MONTH(order_date) AS order_month,
        SUM(sale_price) AS sales
    FROM 
        df_orders
    GROUP BY 
        YEAR(order_date), MONTH(order_date)
)
SELECT 
    order_month,
    SUM(CASE WHEN order_year = 2022 THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS sales_2022,
    SUM(CASE WHEN order_year = 2023 THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS sales_2023
FROM 
    cte
GROUP BY 
    order_month
ORDER BY 
    order_month;
```
Explanation
YEAR() and MONTH(): Extracts year and month from order_date.
SUM(CASE WHEN ...): Calculates total sales for each year.
GROUP BY: Groups results by month.
ORDER BY: Sorts results by month.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Query 4: Highest Sales Month for Each Category
### Purpose
To determine which month had the highest sales for each product category.
SQL Code (Microsoft SQL Server)
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        category,
        FORMAT(order_date, 'yyyyMM') AS order_year_month,
        SUM(sale_price) AS sales
    FROM 
        df_orders
    GROUP BY 
        category, FORMAT(order_date, 'yyyyMM')
)
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT *,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY category ORDER BY sales DESC) AS rn
    FROM cte
) a
WHERE rn = 1;
```
### Explanation üìù:

- **FORMAT(order_date, 'yyyyMM')** ‚û°Ô∏è Formats the `order_date` into a year and month format (`yyyyMM`) üìÖ.
- **ROW_NUMBER()** ‚û°Ô∏è Ranks the months by sales within each category, assigning a unique rank to each month based on the sales amount üìä.
- **WHERE rn = 1** ‚û°Ô∏è Filters the result to select only the month with the highest sales per category üèÖ.


## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Query 5: Subcategory with Highest Growth by Profit in 2023 Compared to 2022
### Purpose
To identify which subcategory experienced the highest profit growth from 2022 to 2023.
SQL Code (PostgreSQL)
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        sub_category,
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS order_year,
        SUM(sale_price) AS sales
    FROM 
        afra_pd
    GROUP BY 
        sub_category, order_year
),
cte2 AS (
    SELECT 
        sub_category,
        SUM(CASE WHEN order_year = 2022 THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS sales_2022,
        SUM(CASE WHEN order_year = 2023 THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS sales_2023
    FROM 
        cte
    GROUP BY 
        sub_category
)
SELECT 
    sub_category,
    sales_2022,
    sales_2023,
    (sales_2023 - sales_2022) AS sales_growth -- Profit growth calculation.
FROM 
    cte2
ORDER BY 
    sales_growth DESC LIMIT 1;
```
### Explanation üìù:

- **EXTRACT(YEAR FROM ...)** ‚û°Ô∏è Retrieves the year from the `order_date` to separate data by year üìÜ.
- **SUM(CASE WHEN ...)** ‚û°Ô∏è Sums up profits for each year per subcategory by using conditional aggregation üí∞.
- **(sales_2023 - sales_2022)** ‚û°Ô∏è Calculates the profit growth by subtracting sales in 2022 from sales in 2023 üìà.
- **ORDER BY ... LIMIT 1** ‚û°Ô∏è Sorts the results to return only the subcategory with the highest growth üèÖ.

5. **Data Visualization**
